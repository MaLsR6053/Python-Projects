# Python-Projects  
This is a place for my Python projects as I learn more about scripting and programming.

# Python Bootcamp:
  - [Bouncer](https://github.com/MaLsR6053/Python-Projects/blob/main/Bouncer_App.py) - Bouncer app that pretends to let you into a nightclub.
  - [Rock, Paper, Scissors v1.3](https://github.com/MaLsR6053/Python-Projects/blob/main/rock_paper_scissors_v1.3.py) - Rock, Paper, Scissors game with ascii art, and masked input to mitigate cheating.

  - [TCP Client Script](https://github.com/MaLsR6053/Python-Projects/blob/main/Python%20TCP%20Client.py) | [TCP Client README](https://github.com/MaLsR6053/Python-Projects/blob/main/TCP%20Client%20README.md) - This script demonstrates how to create a simple TCP client using Python's socket module. It sends a small message to a specified target host and port, then listens for and prints the response.
  - [UDP Client Script](https://github.com/MaLsR6053/Python-Projects/blob/main/Python%20UDP%20Client.py) | [UDP Client README](https://github.com/MaLsR6053/Python-Projects/blob/main/UPD%20Client%20README.md) - This script demonstrates how to create a simple UDP client using Python's socket module. It sends a small message to a specified target host and port, then listens for and prints the response.
  - [SQLi Password Brute Force](https://github.com/MaLsR6053/Python-Projects/blob/main/sqli_lab_password_brute.py) - Original credit goes to: [rkhal101](https://github.com/rkhal101/Web-Security-Academy-Series/blob/main/sql-injection/lab-11/sqli-lab-11.py). I simply made the script a bit more user-friendly, however, the base functionality of the script remains unchanged.
  - [Brute Force Web Login](https://github.com/MaLsR6053/Python-Projects/blob/main/Brute-Force-Web-Login.py) - A script to brute-force a login page by testing various password combinations for a given username.
  - [Directory Bruteforce](https://github.com/MaLsR6053/Python-Projects/blob/main/MaLsR-Dirb-Bruteforce.py) - This script performs directory enumeration by testing a list of common directory names on a web server to find exposed files or directories.
  - [Subdomain Enumeration](https://github.com/MaLsR6053/Python-Projects/blob/main/MaLsR-sub-enum.py) - This script attempts to discover subdomains of a given domain by querying DNS records.
  - [SSL/TLS Vulnerability Check](https://github.com/MaLsR6053/Python-Projects/blob/main/MaLsR-SSL-TLS-vuln-checker.py) - This script checks if a given host supports SSL/TLS protocols by attempting to establish a secure connection.
  - [Payload Encoder for XSS](https://github.com/MaLsR6053/Python-Projects/blob/main/Payload-Encoder-XSS.py) - A script that encodes XSS payloads to help evade web security filters during testing.
